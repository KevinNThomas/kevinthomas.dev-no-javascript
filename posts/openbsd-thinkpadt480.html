                        <p>This guide will explain how I installed and setup OpenBSD on my Thinkpad T480 with full
                            disk encryption, and how I improved the slowness I was experiencing out of the box.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            My specs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Model: Thinkpad T480</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Installation</h3>
                        <h4>Setting up installation media</h4>
                        Installing OpenBSD with full disk encryption was actually fairly simple. Install the amd64
                        .img file from the OpenBSD website here:
                        <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Download" target="_blank">
                            https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Download</a>. Grab a flash drive and format it
                        with the FAT 32 file system (this can be done easily with a graphical tool like GParted).
                        Burn the .img file to the flashdrive with the following command (make sure you are burning
                        to the right device, the <code>dd</code> command can be dangerous):
                        <pre>
sudo dd bs=4M if=Downloads/openbsd.img of=/dev/sdb conv=fdatasync
</pre>
                        Now, reboot your laptop, and press "Enter" on the splash screen and enter your BIOS settings.
                        Navigate to the boot section and select your USB device as your boot device. Save and exit.
                        <h4>Full disk encryption</h4>
                        Let's setup full disk encryption. The OpenBSD website has a great guide on this:
                        <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#softraidFDE">
                            https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#softraidFDE
                        </a>. Following that guide exactly worked great for me. I recommend choosing the GPT option for
                        UEFI booting, as that is how the Thinkpad T480 boots by default. Keep in mind the
                        <code>sd#</code> that it chooses for you might be different than the <code>sd1</code> in the
                        guide, and that's okay (for example, I believe <code>sd1</code> was my USB drive when I did
                        my installation, so the installer defaulted to <code>sd3</code>, which worked fine). Once you go
                        through that guide, you should already be back at the main installer and have chosen your new
                        device
                        for installation.
                        <h4>Main installation</h4>
                        The installer is very simple, as almost every prompt has sane default values that you can change
                        if you know you want to. For the network interface selection, you're going to want to select
                        <code>em0</code> for now, as that is the ethernet interface which will work out of the box.
                        We will setup wifi later. I also used <code>dhcp</code> for the IP address. I chose to install
                        the X Window System and create a user account. For disk partitioning, you can confirm you are
                        installing
                        to the right disk by pressing the '?' key and seeing your list of devices, confirming which one
                        you
                        set as your root partition earlier. Use whole disk GPT Partitioning if you chose GPT earlier
                        when
                        setting up disk encryption.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For the disk layout, you could just use the automatic layout, but I prefer all my directories on
                        the same
                        partition, so I used this custom layout:
                        <pre>
sd0> a b
offset: [128]
size: [xxx] 8G
FS type: [swap]
sd0*> a
partition: [a]
offset: [xxx]
size: [xxx]
FS type: [4.2BSD]
mount point: [none] /
sd0*> w
sd0> q
</pre>
                        After this, you can simply select <code>http</code> for the location of sets, and select a close
                        mirror.
                        Then, you should be done. Just restart to boot into your new OS (make sure to remove your USB
                        drive).
                        <h3>Post-installation setup</h3>
                        <h4>doas</h4>
                        Getting the <code>doas</code> command to work with your normal user makes life a lot easier
                        because you
                        can perform operations with root level privilege. First switch to your root user:
                        <code>su root</code>.
                        Then, edit the doas conf file: <code>vi /etc/doas.conf</code>. Put this line in the conf file:
                        <code>permit :wheel</code>. This will allow users in the wheel group to use the
                        <code>doas</code> command
                        (your user should already be in that group). You can now use <code>doas</code> to run commands
                        requiring
                        root level permissions, like installing packages: <code>doas pkg_add vim</code>.
                        <h4>Wifi</h4>
                        You probably want to get wifi setup. Install missing firmware with: <code>doas fw_update</code>.
                        Run the command <code>ifconfig</code> to see your list of network interfaces. Your wifi
                        interface should
                        be <code>iwm0</code>, so you should create the following file for this interface:
                        <code>doas vim /etc/hostname.iwm0</code>. Inside the file, setup your wifi credentials like this
                        (replacing "MyWifiNetwork" and "MyWifiPassword" with their actual values):
                        <pre>
nwid MyWifiNetwork wpakey MyWifiPassword
dhcp
</pre>
                        Connect to your wifi network by running: <code>doas dhclient iwm0</code>. You shoud now have
                        your wifi setup.
                        <h3>Improving slowness</h3>
                        OpenBSD was basically unusably slow out of the box on my Thinkpad T480. Here are the steps I
                        took to improve
                        its slowness and make it useable for desktop tasks.
                        <h4>Thunderbolt</h4>
                        There seem to be conflicting reports on how Thunderbolt plays an effect on OpenBSD being slow on
                        the T480.
                        u/bioctl on reddit <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/gs3c9i/openbsd_slow_after_suspend/"
                            target="_blank">reported</a> that Thunderbolt seemed to be causing an acpi0 interrupt that
                        would slow
                        down their T480, so they disabled it. However,
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgJUy9Bx4wo" target="_blank">iBSD</a> reports that
                        enabling
                        "Thunderbold BIOS Assist" in the BIOS settings is what fixes the slowness issue (specifically
                        after
                        a shutdown rather than a restart). I believe this is what fixed the issue for me, so the iBSD
                        fix
                        is the one I would recommend trying first.
                        <h4>Use intel driver</h4>
                        By default Xorg was using the modsetting driver which I believe has worse performance than the
                        intel driver.
                        To use the intel driver, create an xorg conf file: <code>doas vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> and
                        add the
                        following:
                        <pre>
Section "Device"
        Identifier "Intel Graphics"
        Driver "intel"
EndSection
</pre>
                        <h4>Add user to staff group and class</h4>
                        The staff group/class is granted more system performance by default, add your user to it:
                        <pre>
doas usermod -L staff user
doas usermod -G staff user
</pre>
                        <h4>Enable apmd</h4>
                        Enable the power management daemon: <code>doas rcctl enable apmd</code>.
                        Then add this line to <code>/etc/rc.conf.local</code>:
                        <pre>
apmd_flags=-A
</pre>

                        This sets the daemon to "automatic performance adjustment mode."
                        <h4>Edit login.conf</h4>
                        The login.conf file is where resource limits for different classes of users are defined.
                        Since I want my user to not be bottlenecked by these limits, I made adjustments in the
                        "staff" section, increasing resource limits by a lot. Edit your <code>/etc/login.conf</code>
                        file,
                        and change the "staff" section to this:
                        <pre>
#
# Staff have fewer restrictions and can login even when nologins are set.
#
staff:\
	:datasize-cur=16384M:\
	:datasize-max=infinity:\
	:maxproc-max=1024:\
	:maxproc-cur=1024:\
	:stacksize-cur=8M:\
	:ignorenologin:\
	:requirehome@:\
	:tc=default:
</pre>
                        <h4>Edit sysctl.conf</h4>
                        I increased some resource limits in my sysctl.conf file as well. Make a
                        <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>
                        file and add these lines:
                        <pre>
kern.maxproc=32768
kern.maxthread=4096
</pre>
                        I believe you can also enable hyperthreading in this file (OpenBSD has it disabled by default
                        for security reasons),
                        however, I choose to keep it off.
                        <h4>Soft Updates</h4>
                        <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#SoftUpdates" target="_blank">Soft Updates</a>
                        can be enabled
                        to improve performance. Simply edit your <code>/etc/fstab</code> file, and make sure the
                        <code>softdep</code>
                        flag is added to your root partition. For example:
                        <pre>
26bfefb4e47ee753.a / ffs rw,wxallowed,softdep 1 1
</pre>
                        <h4>ulimit</h4>
                        Add this line to your <code>~/.xsession</code> to disable home directory core dumps:
                        <code>ulimit -Sc 0</code>
                        <h4>mfs</h4>
                        You can use an <a href="https://dataswamp.org/%7Esolene/2018-05-08-mfs-tmp.html"
                            target="_blank">mfs</a>
                        filesystem for your cache directory to improve performance. Simply create an entry for it in
                        your
                        <code>/etc/fstab</code> file:
                        <pre>
swap /home/kevin/.cache mfs rw,nodev,nosuid,-s=300m 0 0
</pre>
                        <h4>Restart your computer</h4>
                        Now, hopefully you see a massive performance gain. You should be able to move windows around
                        without lag,
                        and Firefox should be responsive and useable.
