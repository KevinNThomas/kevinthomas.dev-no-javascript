                        <p>Recently, after booting up my laptop after it ran out of power, I ran into this error
							after being dumped into the initramfs emergency shell:
							<pre>
mount: mounting /dev/mapper/vg0-root on /sysroot failed: I/O error
</pre>
							This ended up happening because of some invalid blocks on my lvm partition
							(I have a fully encrypted LVM on LUKS setup on my machine).
							Here's how I was able to fix it (this was on Alpine Linux, hopefully it helps with other
							distros too):
							<h3>Flash your distro's live image to a USB drive and boot into it</h3>
							You need to be running an external environment to repair your partition.
							<h3>Install the necessary packages</h3>
							For me, this was lvm2, cryptsetup, and e2fsprogs:
							<pre>
apk add lvm2 cryptsetup e2fsprogs
</pre>
							<h3>Setup LUKS partition</h3>
							In my case, <code>/dev/sda2</code> was my LUKS container partition:
							<pre>
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2
</pre>
							<h3>Activate the logical volumes</h3>
							<pre>
vgchange -ay
</pre>
							<h3>vgscan with --mknodes</h3>
							I found that this was needed for the repair to work. After running this command:
							<pre>
vgscan --mknodes
</pre>
							And running <code>blkid</code>, I found three new entires, one of them being:
							<pre>
/dev/dm-3
</pre>
							This entry had the same UUID as my <code>/dev/mapper/vg0-root</code> partition,
							so I knew this is the one I needed to repair.
							<h3>Run fsck to fix the partition</h3>
							Since my partition was an ext4 partition:
							<pre>
fsck -t ext4 /dev/dm-3
</pre>
							In my case, this detected some journal checksum errors that this program was able to
							fix. After fixing them, I was able to boot into my machine again. I hope this helps
							anyone running into this problem!
